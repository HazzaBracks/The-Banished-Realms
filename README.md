# The-Banished-Realms
A game project that me and my friends are working on. It is a text-based game based in the medieval era with pixelated videos, retro audio, interactive GUI, and most importantly a lot of text.
This game will also be developed @DrSquidX and I(although most of it is me), as we had both came up with the ideas that made up the game, as well as all of the concepts for it.
