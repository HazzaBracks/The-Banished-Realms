# The-Banished-Realms
A game project that I am working on. It is a text-based game based in the medieval era with an interactive GUI, and most importantly a lot of text.
This game will be developed by me, but me and my friend (DrSquidX) both came up with the ideas that make up the game, as well as all of the concepts for it.

The premise of the game is that you are a lone adventurer who is a skilled warrior, who has to fight their way through many enemies, earn money from quests, and upgrade their gear.
All you have to do is type in “y” or “n” when prompted, and for the most common type of input, typing in a simple “a”, “b”, “c”, and whatever other letters there are available.
All decisions that you make during the game will have a guaranteed impact later on, as weapon choice may be the difference may be the difference between life and death.
I am doing a “demo” of sorts as a school project, but I will continue working on the game as a hobby, and continue expanding the story, and expanding my pygame and python coding skill set.

In this project I had to learn how to use pygame effectively for visuals, and once the school project is over, (Since I didn’t have enough time for it)
I will learn how to put keybinds and images together to form a cohesive GUI which is completely foolproof, and any other inputs will not have an effect, rendering my game very intuitive.

In the game, I also credit all of the artist from which I used art in order to pixelate and put into my game.
