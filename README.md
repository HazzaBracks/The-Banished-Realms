# The-Banished-Realms
A game project that me and my friends are working on. It is a text-based game based in the medieval era with pixelated videos, retro audio, interactive GUI, and most importantly a lot of text.
This game will also be developed by me and also @DrSquidX, as we had both came up with the ideas that made up the game, as well as all of the concepts for it.
