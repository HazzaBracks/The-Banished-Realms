# The-Banished-Realms
A game project that I am working on. It is a text-based game based in the medieval era with pixelated videos, retro audio, interactive GUI, and most importantly a lot of text.
This game will be developed by me, but me and my friend (DrSquidX) both came up with the ideas that make up the game, as well as all of the concepts for it.
